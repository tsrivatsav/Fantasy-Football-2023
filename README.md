# Fantasy-Football-2023

This project aims to predict NFL players' statistical performances for the 2023 season.
We do so by: 
1. Scraping historical player data
2. Preprocessing the data the filter for relevance
3. Training a Machine Learning model on each player's career
4. Predicting player statistics for the upcoming season
5. Translating that into fantasy points based on my league's rules.
